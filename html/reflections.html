            <p>Growing up, I always considered my language and verbal skills to be stronger than my abilities in more "technical" subjects.</p>
            <p>In school, I easily scored well in English and Literature but was a mediocre student in math and science. When I graduated, I pursued a career that mainly involved writing and editing.</p>
            <p>Given my background, I was slightly apprehensive about taking a course that was heavy in computer science. I was intimidated by the complexity of algorithms, and worried about whether I had the mathematical skills to even begin to understand them.</p>
            <p>While I dabbled in different coding languages like Python and JavaScript along the way, including by taking a variety of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), I often struggled to find meaningful ways to apply what I learned or relate it to anything else I knew. </p>
            <p>As a result, I found it hard to make any progress. I would sometimes start a programming or data science MOOC and abandon it within days, convinced I just did not have the time or aptitude for it.</p>
            <p>However, the module on computational thinking has helped ease my concerns by providing a solid foundation on which I feel that I can build future learning.</p>

            <h3>Back to the basics</h3>
            <p>Instead of diving straight into programming languages, we began by learning the very basic processes behind how computers work (such as the use of binary numbers) and how computer scientists think.</p>
            <p>At first, I was a bit confused about why we were discussing the steps required to make tea in a classroomful of Masters students. But understanding that no matter how complex a problem seems it can be broken into smaller, manageable parts has proved useful as my course progresses.</p>
            <p>One of the most useful pieces of advice from this course has been to be more deliberate about planning before going into the technicalities. When designing this website, I resisted the urge to start coding immediately, and went through several sketches of how I wanted my website to look first before thinking of how I wanted to build it.</p>
            <p>We were also introduced to programming in very generic terms, not through any particular language. We learned concepts like variables, expressions, statements and iteration. We even used a made-up programming language, BennieScript, to test our understanding of these concepts.</p>
            <p>This focus on the key concepts common to most programming languages without getting bogged down by too much detail about the syntax – an example of abstraction – has provided a crucial framework for learning computer science in more depth.</p>
            <p>In the past, I have been overwhelmed by the number of different programming languages because they all seemed unrelated.</p>
            <p>Learning about the common concepts behind them has made it easier to spot patterns and generalise my knowledge of one language to another. Iterating in BennieScript is not that different from iterating in JavaScript, after all.</p>

            <h3>Pushing through the threshold</h3>
            <p>I also found the discussion of threshold concepts (Meyer and Land 2005) in Week 2 particularly useful for dealing with the frustration that invariably comes with learning something new and difficult – which has in the past often caused me to give up.</p>
            <p>It is quite common to feel a sense of reward when one is good at something, which is why I think when I was younger, the more I naturally performed well in a certain subject, the more I gravitated towards it. The converse is also true, and if I was not as good at something as other people, I would reason that my strengths lay elsewhere and stop trying.</p>
            <p>In recent years I better appreciate the role of effort, moving towards a “growth mindset” (Dweck 2015) of believing that intelligence can be developed with hard work, and away from the “fixed mindset” of thinking that success is largely based on fixed traits like talent and natural intelligence.</p>
            <p>Learning in class that a new concept that feels “troublesome” (Meyer and Land 2005) may indicate that it is in fact transformative and has the potential to open up new realms of knowledge – making it more than worth the effort – has given me greater motivation and confidence to persevere in my learning and attempt to push through thresholds to achieve breakthroughs. </p>
